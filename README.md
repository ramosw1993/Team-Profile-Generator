# Team-Profile-Generator

## Project Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application that lives in Node and requests information from the user about members of a team and generates an HTML file displaying that information. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.

When the program is initatiated then the manager is prompted to input their information, then they are prompted to select their team via a drop down list.

Then when all the information is submitted an html page will render based on the results inputted.
